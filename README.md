# To Do List

An Angular "to-do list" application.

## What I Learned

* Angular
* NGXS (State Management)
* Routing
* Storybook
* Implemented functinality to the UI: onCreate, onAddItem, setupListViewListener, readItems, & writeItems.
* Integrated setOnItemLongClickListener to remove items from the list.

## Use Case Senarios
The uers should be able to...

* Add todos to a list
* Check the todos they have completed
* Remove a todo
* See a list with all the 'Active' todos
* See a list with all the 'Completed' todos
